"""agent.archetype_pack — the goal-archetype marketplace format
(exponential-build-4 G), extending the signed-rule-pack distribution
model (diagnostics/rulepack.py) to the agent's HTN goal archetypes.

TREATED AS MATERIALLY HIGHER RISK THAN A RULE PACK, and the module is
built like it: a rule pack shares FACTS (symptom -> fix text, inert);
an archetype describes ACTIONS — HTN nodes bound to the agent's
dispatchers. The import gate is therefore structural, not advisory:

  1. INTEGRITY — the manifest's payload_sha256 must equal the sha256
     of the canonical serialization of the embedded payload (the
     rulepack contract verbatim);
  2. ACTION WHITELIST — every node's ``action`` must resolve to an
     ALREADY-DECLARED dispatcher in this installation
     (agent.engine.default_dispatchers()). Nothing freeform: an
     archetype cannot name a dispatcher that does not exist, and
     cannot bring its own executors;
  3. NO CODE CAN ENTER — an archetype document is a JSON data
     document with a CLOSED field set (id, title, description,
     nodes; node fields: id, action, title, risk, consent, params,
     depends, required_capability). Unknown fields are rejected, so
     there is no field a payload of code could hide in; the repo-wide
     AST import lint continues to guard the Python side;
  4. RISK + CONSENT — node risk tiers must be valid
     (diagnostics.risk.RISK_ORDER), and every node at
     STATE_CHANGING or above must carry consent=True, mirroring the
     engine's own discipline;
  5. CAPABILITY — a node may declare ``required_capability``; the
     name must be one of the manifest's known capabilities
     (capabilities.DEFAULTS). The import NEVER grants it: the record
     says "required, NOT granted", and the engine's own
     capabilities.enabled check applies at execution exactly as it
     does for built-in archetypes. No imported archetype silently
     inherits any grant an existing archetype already has;
  6. REVIEW-ONLY — imported archetypes land in the learned-state
     JSON under archetype_pack.STATE_KEY with status "review-only".
     They are NOT registered into the engine's dispatch table by
     import; registration/promotion is a human decision this module
     deliberately does not implement (see OPEN_QUESTIONS).

SIGNING HAPPENS OUTSIDE, identically to the rulepack and lexicon-diff
contracts: the exporter writes canonical bytes; the sharer detaches a
signature with their own tool; the recipient verifies BEFORE import.
The assistant's part is integrity + structure, not cryptography.

guessed at): see the OPEN_QUESTIONS constant below.
