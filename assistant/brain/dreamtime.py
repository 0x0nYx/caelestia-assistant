"""Decide whether now is a good time to run heavier batch jobs (organize,
drift check, health scan) and which ones fit in the window — orchestration
only. This module never spawns anything itself (ALLOWED_IMPORTS bans
subprocess for the whole assistant); the caller outside this layer is
responsible for actually invoking whichever jobs get chosen.

Phase 2.1 adds the closed loop around that decision: a CadenceController
that reads diagnostics/telemetry.py's read-only /proc+/sys snapshots
DURING a run and adjusts the scan/brain batch cadence so the machine
stays under a configurable CPU ceiling. It is a PI controller with a
bounded integral (anti-windup) and explicit actuator limits — the
standard loop shape (Astrom & Hagglund 1995, "PID Controllers: Theory,
Design, and Tuning"); no new write path, no scheduler, no thread: the
runner calls observe() between job steps and honors the returned
cadence.
