"""brain.features — the shared feature-hashing scheme (phase 2.4).

The hashing trick (Weinberger, Daslambert, Smola & Atreya 2009, "Feature
hashing for large scale multitask learning", ICML): tokens are mapped
into a fixed d-dimensional space by a seeded hash, with signed
collision resolution — the projection that lets many learners share ONE
feature function without sharing state.

Why this module exists: the router (cortex), the genius meta router,
and the preset/plan learners each keep SEPARATELY AUDITABLE state
files — that boundary is deliberate (RATIONALE's per-learner
reviewability) — but they can still TRANSFER signal on structurally
similar inputs by agreeing on the same feature mapping. Share the
projection, never the state.

Guarantees:
- PURE: no I/O, no randomness at call time (the hash is deterministic
  and seeded); identical input yields identical features, always.
- stdlib only (hashlib); d is bounded (callers use 8..64).
- Signed hashing: the sign comes from a second hash bit, halving the
  effective collision bias (the 2009 paper's own trick).
