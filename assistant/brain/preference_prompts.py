"""brain.preference_prompts — idle-time paired-comparison preference
elicitation (exponential-build-3 G2), riding the dreamtime idle
cadence with a hard frequency cap.

The design in one paragraph: the assistant already learns preset
preferences, but ONLY from comparisons the user thinks to run
(`settings --prefer A B`). The Elo/Bradley-Terry ladder is only as
good as the pairs the user bothers to compare — and the user does not
know WHICH comparison would be most informative. During idle windows
(the dreamtime cadence: eligible() decides whether a window may open
at all), the assistant may invite ONE pairwise comparison, chosen
where the answer buys the most ranking information: the pair with the
FEWEST recorded comparisons, tie-broken by the CLOSEST Elo ratings
(the most uncertain ordering — the classic active-learning choice for
a Bradley-Terry ladder). The invitation is a prompt RECORD, never an
interruption: it surfaces in `settings --rank` and is answered by the
ordinary `settings --prefer A B`, which consumes it when the pair
matches.

FREQUENCY CAP (the master constraint, enforced structurally):
- at most ONE unanswered prompt exists at any time;
- at least MIN_DAYS_BETWEEN (7) days between prompts, tracked in the
  state's prompt history — a prompt is generated only when the cap
  allows, and the reason is returned when it does not;
- prompts EXPIRE (MAX_AGE_DAYS, 14): an unanswered invitation older
  than that is withdrawn (moved to history as 'expired') rather than
  nagging forever.

Pair selection is deterministic: (fewest comparisons, smallest Elo
rating difference, sorted pair) — same state, same prompt (pinned by
test). Pure module: no I/O, no RNG, no clock reads (``now`` is
caller-supplied, the fixture-injection pattern); the only writer is
the caller persisting the returned state fragment through the
existing brain-state path.
