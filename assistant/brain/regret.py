"""brain.regret — the periodic regret-vs-best-fixed audit for every
Beta bandit in the repo (exponential-build 3.3).

The question it answers, printed rather than claimed: "did the bandit
actually beat just always doing the single best thing?" The baseline is
the BEST-FIXED-ARM-IN-HINDSIGHT: the arm with the best observed mean
reward, multiplied across the whole horizon — the reward the user would
plausibly have collected had the bandit done nothing clever at all.

Two input shapes, same audit:

- ``audit_from_arms``: the aggregate Beta posteriors every bandit
  already persists ({name: [alpha, beta]}) — the reward sums and play
  counts are derived from the evidence (the prior's own mass is never
  counted; a flat-seeded arm has n = 0);
- ``audit_from_draws``: an explicit per-round draw log
  [(arm, reward), ...] where one exists.

Honesty accounting: the best-fixed total is an ESTIMATE (it assumes
the best arm's observed mean would have held over the whole horizon —
unplayed rounds are unobserved, and the report says exactly that);
the regret figure inherits that caveat and is never described as a
bound; a bandit with fewer than two played arms has no policy
comparison to make and says so; an untouched bandit (no plays at all)
is an abstention, not a zero. Deterministic, pure, no I/O — the CLI
surfaces it, nothing acts on it.
