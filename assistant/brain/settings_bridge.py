"""Wires the settings layer (issue #120) into the brain's proposal ledger.

Nothing in this module is a new write path. It only orchestrates three
pieces that already exist and already own their own safety guarantees:

- assistant.settings.planner:  ops -> a validated, read-only plan
- assistant.settings.applier:  plan -> a gated write (write=True only)
- assistant.brain.ledger:      every autonomous suggestion is a proposal
                                until the user decides

The point is to make "the assistant proposes, the user approves" (#120's
own framing, and the same pattern brain/service.py already uses for tag
and dedup suggestions) the *one* interaction model for settings changes
too, instead of a separate CLI-only --confirm prompt: a proposal sits in
the ledger, durable and inspectable, until ledger_decide() resolves it.
Approving a proposal here is the literal act of confirmation (#120's
"Apply these changes?"), so -- and only then -- this module calls the
applier with write=True. Rejecting, or leaving it pending, writes nothing.

A settings proposal also feeds preset_bandit.NamedBandit -- for a named
preset directly under its own name, and for *any* proposal (preset or raw
--call) once more per touched tool, under a "tool:" prefix -- so approvals
and rejections become the learning signal for recommend(), and both
"which preset do you keep" and "which individual settings do you keep"
views improve, without ever touching which presets exist or how a tool
validates.

When the caller does not pin a confidence, propose() asks calibrate.py's
acceptance_rate for this ledger's own history on kind="settings": a user
who has been rejecting settings proposals gets a lower default confidence
next time (an honestly calibrated number, per calibrate.py's own stated
purpose), instead of a flat, always-optimistic 0.7.
