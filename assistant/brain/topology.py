"""Per-monitor-topology config memory (issue #120 Phase 3 roadmap:
"monitor-specific layouts", implemented as a Phase 2.2 memory engine).

What it does, in one sentence: hash the connected-monitor set, and when the
set changes, look up the config deltas that were active the last time that
exact set was connected, and PROPOSE them in the ledger — never auto-apply.

Data sources (verified against the upstream caelestia-kde tree before
writing a line of this module — none are invented):

- The per-monitor override directories the shell's own config loader
  maintains: ``<shell.json's dir>/monitors/<screen-name>/shell.json``
  (see shell/plugin/src/Caelestia/Config/common.cpp::monitorConfigDir and
  assistant/settings/planner.py::_monitor_warnings, which already scans
  the same layout read-only). The set of screen-name directories is the
  persisted "connected-monitor set" this module hashes.
- Resolution/position are deliberately NOT part of the fingerprint: the
  upstream shell persists no such data on disk (the workspace-tracker
  effect broadcasts live state only; KWin's kwinoutputconfig.json is not
  read by the shell), and inventing a schema the shell does not write is
  exactly what this task forbids. The fingerprint is the sorted screen
  name set — count and identity, honestly scoped.

Deltas: for each monitor override file, the entries whose value differs
from the registry default are recorded as {"tool", "path", "value"} rows
(registry paths only; global-only tools are skipped — they cannot live in
a per-monitor overlay, matching planner's own [C6]/§4.6 discipline).

Writes: the learned memory lives in the brain's one state JSON (an
enumerated write path), and proposals go through the existing ledger —
the same two mechanisms every other brain feature uses. Nothing is ever
written to shell.json by this module.
