"""Session clustering -> workspace profiles (issue #120 Phase 3 roadmap:
"personalized desktop presets" / "workspace profiles"), Phase 2.1.

k-means over (app, workspace, monitor, hour-of-day) session vectors;
clusters that co-occur consistently become NAMED PROFILE PROPOSALS in the
existing ledger. Nothing is ever auto-applied: the ledger's
approve/reject flow is the whole interaction, exactly like every other
brain proposal.

DATA SOURCE — verified, not assumed (2026-09-26, upstream caelestia-kde):
the shell persists NO per-session (app, workspace, monitor, hour) log.
The workspace-tracker KWin effect broadcasts live state over a local
socket for the bar widget and writes nothing to disk
(shell/kwin-effects/workspace-tracker/workspace_tracker.cpp: a socket
write, no file); the launcher's apps.sqlite stores aggregate launch
counts, not sessions. This module therefore consumes EXPLICITLY
SUPPLIED session records — the same caller-supplied-series pattern as
brain/rhythm.py, brain/forecast.py and brain/dreamtime.py — and says so
plainly. If upstream ever persists a real session log, only the caller
changes; the schema here stays {"app": str, "workspace": int,
"monitor": str, "hour": 0-23}.

Pipeline (every step a named, citable technique):

1. Feature encoding — one-hot app (rare apps below `min_count` fold into
   "__other__"), one-hot monitor, min-max normalized workspace index, and
   circular hour encoding (sin/cos of 2*pi*h/24, the standard time-of-day
   embedding, so hour 23 neighbors hour 0).
2. k-means with k-means++ seeding (reuses genius/data.py::kmeans — the
   same deterministic implementation the genius layer ships and tests;
   k defaults to the min(8, max(2, round(sqrt(n/2)))) heuristic and is
   caller-overridable).
3. Cluster purity filter (standard cluster-purity metric): a cluster is
   proposed only when its modal (app, monitor, workspace) triple covers
   >= `purity` of its members AND it has >= `min_support` sessions —
   consistency is the point; noise is not a profile.
4. Proposal via ledger.propose(kind="workspace_profile", ...,
   confidence=purity) — the existing vocabulary, no fourth mechanism.

Read-only except the ledger proposal it is given a Ledger to make.
