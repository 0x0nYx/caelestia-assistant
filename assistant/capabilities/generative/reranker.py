"""generative.reranker — the optional sub-1B candidate reorder (E2,
Group E).

The deterministic router already ranks candidates; a sub-1B model will
not out-rank it on a good day. The ONE place a tiny model can help is
the router's own low-confidence margin, where the difference between
candidate #1 and #2 is noise the router itself flags. This module
re-orders the ROUTER'S OWN candidate list with one loopback generate()
call — and is built so the model can do exactly nothing else:

- the model never sees the registry, only the candidate list the
  router already produced, so it cannot invent a tool;
- the output is parsed under a constrained format: a line that is
  EXACTLY one candidate name (first exact match wins). Anything else
  the model emits — code fences, commentary, hallucinated names — is
  dropped and counted, never parsed loosely;
- the result is a REORDER of candidates, marked MODEL_SUGGESTED on
  every surfaced element, and the caller still routes any resulting
  change through the ordinary plan/apply gates (invariant 1: the only
  write path in the product). A model suggestion here can change the
  ORDER of an ask, never produce an answer or an apply;
- OFF by default twice: the layer's own --generative gate AND the
  model_reranker capability (a file edit — a request cannot flip it);
- one attempt, loopback-only, through the EXISTING client transport
  (client.generate); an unavailable server degrades to UNCHANGED —
  the deterministic order always stands.

Verified candidates (Ollama library, fetched live 2026-09-30; sizes are
the library's own download numbers):

  - smollm2:135m  (271 MB)  Apache 2.0   HuggingFaceTB SmolLM2
  - smollm2:360m  (726 MB)  Apache 2.0   HuggingFaceTB SmolLM2
  - qwen2.5:0.5b  (398 MB)  Apache 2.0*  *per the library page: all
                            Qwen2.5 models except the 3B and 72B are
                            Apache 2.0

All three are IN the Ollama model library (unlike the apertus family
the old MODELS.md recommended, which had no listing at all). Serving
one is a user-side step; the assistant downloads nothing, ever.

Determinism, stated plainly: model output is NOT deterministic, so this
module must never sit on a path where its output is trusted without the
deterministic layers' validation. The tests therefore run it against a
fake connection factory (the established pattern from test_assisted.py)
— no test touches a network, and no production path trusts the model
without a registry-validated plan behind it.
