"""cortex.coldstart — DP-noised community priors for a fresh install
(exponential-build-4 G).

The gap: a new install's bandits start flat (Beta(1,1) everywhere) and
learn the user's tool-usage shape from zero. The community fix: users
who already have history EXPORT a noised summary of their bandit
evidence; a fresh install IMPORTS it as its starting priors instead of
flat ones.

THE PRIVACY MECHANISM IS NOT NEW — deliberately. cortex/dp.py's
Laplace mechanism (Dwork, McSherry, Nissim & Smith 2006) was built for
the lexicon-diff export; this module REUSES it (dp.laplace_noise, the
same inverse-CDF sampling, the same sensitivity accounting, the same
epsilon semantics) pointed at bandit evidence instead of phrase
counts. Per-arm sensitivities: alpha and beta are per-user COUNTS in
the neighboring relation "this user's history in / out", so
N_SENSITIVITY = 1.0 each — the same accounting dp.py already
documents. Composition across arms: the export noises each arm
independently at the caller's epsilon (the artifact records the
epsilon it was made at; importing does not re-noise).

What is exported: the Beta POSTERIOR parameters (alpha, beta) per
strategy/tool arm — aggregates, never rows. Post-processing is the
standard DP kind: noised parameters are CLIPPED to the flat-prior
floor (1.0) on import, and the clip is recorded in the import report;
noising first then clipping keeps the DP guarantee (post-processing
of DP output is DP).

Honesty: the imported priors are EVIDENCE WITH PROVENANCE, not
truth — the import report carries the artifact's epsilon, the marker
string, and per-arm clip status; a user can inspect the artifact
(canonical JSON) before importing; and nothing forces the import
(flat priors remain the default). State stays in the caller's
learned-state JSON; nothing here writes.
