"""Multi-intent clause splitting: one sentence, many settings.

parser.py deliberately refuses compound requests ("multiple value phrases
found in one request; split that into separate requests") because a
frozen grammar cannot attribute values to tools safely. The cortex
router can: each clause gets routed independently, and the pipeline
composes the per-clause plans into one multi-op proposal — which then
goes through the SAME multi-change confirmation gate (``--confirm`` /
ledger approval) that single-sentence multi-setting presets use.

Algorithm — deterministic clause segmentation:

1. Split on coordinating/contrastive conjunctions and commas OUTSIDE
   any protectable span. Splits happen only when BOTH sides carry
   addressable content (a noun hit, a direction/bool/position/number
   cue, or a non-stopword token count above threshold) — "blur and
   transparency" is one concept, "disable blur and move the bar up" is
   two intents.
2. Contrast scope: "but keep the blur on" / "except the dock" clauses
   are marked ``contrast`` so the pipeline treats them as
   negative-scoped (a request to NOT touch, or to restore, that thing)
   rather than a second change.
3. Each clause is routed via router.route; clause results are merged
   left-to-right (later clauses win conflicts, mirroring how humans
   read "make it bigger but the dock smaller").

PURE module: no I/O, no randomness. Deterministic for identical input.

# A small, explicitly declared DAG over tool names: an edge (A -> B) means
# A must be applied BEFORE B. The only order-sensitive shape the shipped
# registry actually has is master-toggle -> dependent-strength inside one
# subsystem (a strength of a mode you are switching off is dead weight and
# can flash a transient state; the mode decision comes first). The table
# is hand-written from the registry's own group structure and cited — not
# inferred at runtime. Tools not in the table keep their spoken order.
#
# Ordering algorithm: stable Kahn topological sort over the ops' tool
# names (indegree ties break by original spoken order, preserving the
# existing "later clause wins" rule), plus last-value deduplication when
# two clauses touch the same tool.
