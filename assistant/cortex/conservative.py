"""cortex.conservative — a safe-exploration floor on the strategy
bandit (exponential-build-4 D).

Wu, Shariff, Lattimore & Szepesvári, "Conservative Bandits", ICML 2016:
unconstrained Thompson sampling will happily spend user experience on
an untested strategy. The conservative design adds a SAFE BASELINE arm
(here: the "balanced" routing profile the repo shipped before any
learning) and the paper's central gate — a non-baseline arm is explored
only when its upper confidence bound clears the safe arm's lower
confidence bound minus the budget ε:

    explore arm i  iff  LCB_i > LCB_safe − ε        (the paper's
    UCB_i ≥ LCB_0 − ε, with the strictness flipped to keep UNSAMPLED
    arms from exploring forever on a degenerate UCB tie),

with Hoeffding radii  r = sqrt(ln(2/δ) / (2n))  over the empirical
mean. The paper's Theorem 1 then gives the guarantee this module
claims, no more and no less: with probability ≥ 1−δ, the total regret
against ALWAYS PLAYING THE SAFE ARM is at most ε·T (+ a constant), i.e.
exploration is provably no worse than the baseline by more than the
per-round budget ε, in expectation. That is a statement about distance
from the BASELINE, not about finding the best arm — an arm better than
the safe one is still exploited once its evidence clears the gate.

ON TOP OF, NOT REPLACING: the Beta posteriors this gate reads are the
strategy bandit's own persisted counts (cortex/learn.py NamedBandit
state) — the same state, a gated policy in front of the Thompson
sample. When the gate refuses an arm, the SAFE arm plays; the sampled
arm is reported honestly as "gated" so the caller can see what
Thompson wanted and what the floor allowed. Determinism: the gate is
pure arithmetic; the Thompson sample comes from the caller's seeded
rng exactly as before. Nothing here writes; state stays in the
caller's learned-state JSON.
