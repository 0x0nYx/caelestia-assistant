"""cortex.dispatch — the unified local-vs-cloud decision point.

One dispatcher, two backends, one existing confidence gate deciding between
them. The decision to serve a request from the local ontology or hand it
off to the (opt-in, user-keyed) cloud sidebar lives HERE — in the cortex
layer's own machinery — never in the sidebar's QML. The sidebar asks the
bridge (op ``dispatch``); this module answers.

THE HAND-OFF RULE (existing gates only — no second threshold system):

- verdict ``ABSTAIN``, or ``QUESTION`` with no candidates at all (nothing
  scored: the router's own min_score gate in effect)  -> cloud,
  reason ``router-abstain``;
- verdict ``DELEGATE`` to a surface WITHOUT an inline runner -> cloud,
  reason ``delegate:<surface>``. A DELEGATE surface WITH an inline
  runner (genius / diagnose / search / brain / issue / agent — the
  routing fix's generalized inline execution, ``cortex/delegate.py``)
  answers LOCALLY: the target layer runs read-only in the same turn
  (the agent always in --simulate) and its answer becomes the sidebar
  bubble. Only a FAILED inline run hands off, reason
  ``delegate:<surface>-inline-failed``;
- verdict ``PLAN`` whose top-route score is NOT covered by the conformal
  calibrator's verdict, when calibration data exists (>= 5 accepted
  routes) -> cloud, reason ``below-conformal-threshold``. No calibration
  data means no distribution-free claim either way — the request stays
  local rather than being punted on a guess;
- everything else stays LOCAL: PLAN (validated ops), QUESTION with
  candidates (the local layer owns the clarification, with its session
  machinery), EXPLAIN / UNDO / LIST / INERT, and runnable DELEGATEs.

GAP LOGGING (every hand-off, §5.2): the state's ``cortex_gaps`` bucket —
the same bounded-bucket discipline as ``cortex_review`` (dedup by shape,
newest-first, bounded) — records the query SHAPE (stemmed, stopword-
filtered, distinctive-token signature) and the intent category, NOT the
raw text: enough to cluster, count and describe the gap later ("N requests
like X fell through"), with no reason to retain user prose. Near-threshold
hand-offs also feed the existing ``cortex_review`` batch surface.

GAP CLUSTERING (§5.3): ``cluster_gaps`` reuses genius' k-means (the same
deterministic implementation workspace.py uses) over the gap vectors, and
applies the SAME minimum-support (3) + cluster-purity (0.6) floor
workspace.py established — a handful of scattered gaps produces ZERO
candidates, by design and by test.

SURFACING (§5.4): ``propose_gap_clusters`` turns a qualifying cluster into
a LEDGER PROPOSAL (kind ``ontology_gap``) — never an automatically-added
tool. The ledger's approve/reject is the whole interaction, exactly like
every other proposal in the system.

Read-only except the state buckets and the ledger proposals it is given;
this module executes nothing and writes no files itself.
