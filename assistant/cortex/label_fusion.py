"""cortex.label_fusion — Dawid-Skene label fusion over the router's own
signals (Group A2).

The router already computes several INDEPENDENT-ish per-candidate
signals (lexical BM25, PPMI cosine, LSA/SVD cosine, char-ngram fuzz,
name-atom coverage, name-bigram addressing, cue-kind agreement). Today
their blend is one weight vector: a candidate wins when the blended
score clears the bar. But a blend can hide a LIE — one signal can drag
a wrong tool over the bar while every other signal prefers something
else (that is exactly what the arena's confident-wrong rows look like).

Dawid-Skene (Dawid & Skene 1979, "A maximum likelihood approach to
extracting information from duplicate records") treats each signal as a
NOISY VOTER over the true surface and fuses their votes with
per-voter reliabilities estimated by unsupervised EM — no labels. The
artefact shipped here is the EM result over the dev routing set:

- voters vote for their per-signal ARGMAX among the router's top-k
  (deterministic tie-break: candidate order, i.e. router rank);
- EM estimates, per voter, sensitivity P(vote = true) and false-vote
  mass P(vote = any specific wrong surface); initialization is the
  majority-agreement posterior (deterministic, no RNG);
- the fused posterior combines with the router's own ranking, and the
  ONLY runtime action is honesty-preserving: a confident ROUTED verdict
  whose top candidate's fused posterior collapses below a threshold
  while other candidates' posteriors rise — i.e. the voters DISAGREE
  with the blend — is DEMOTED to AMBIGUOUS (an honest ask). The
  clarifier (A4) then asks its question. Nothing is ever promoted or
  re-ranked; no verdict becomes MORE confident from fusion.

Why demote-only: the merge gate pays for capability, not risk. A
demotion turns a possible confident-wrong into an honest ask — bounded
downside, zero new write surface, verdicts stay honest. Promotion (ask
-> confident) is exactly the behavior that can manufacture confident
wrongs, so it does not exist here.

CRF/perceptron slot taggers and the CART tree join the vote pool the
moment a trained model exists in user state (``vote()`` accepts any
voter dict); at cold start — the only state the arena can assume —
they abstain and are counted as absent, never as votes.
