"""cortex.lexicon_diff — federated, opt-in, signed lexicon-diff sharing
(phase 2.6, proposals/2026-09-26-c-lexicon-diff-sharing.md).

The shareable artifact is a plain-text, reviewable list of
``phrase -> tool`` mappings a user's cortex has learned (reroute
corrections + approved routes), capped at the newest 200, PII-stripped
to the undo log's standard: no timestamps, no file paths, no values —
phrases are the only content, and phrases are what the user chose to
type at the assistant.

Federation means reviewable text over the channels the community
already uses (issue threads, matrix, fork PRs) — NO server, NO
network code, NO crypto code in the assistant (the import allow-list
is untouched). "Signed" happens OUTSIDE: an Ed25519 detached signature
over the canonical diff text produced and verified by a tool the user
already trusts (minisign / sq / GPG); the assistant only states whose
corpus a diff claims to be — trust in that identity stays a human
decision.

The module is PURE (no I/O): the caller loads/saves the brain state.
State shape (new key, forward-compatible):

    state["lexicon_imports"] = {
        "<diff-id>": {
            "rows": [{"text", "surface", "n", "p", "label"}],
            "at": "2026-09-26T..."   # import time, local metadata only
        }, ...
    }

The diff-id is sha256[:12] of the canonical row text — `forget` drops
the set by id, restoring the pre-import pair list (and therefore the
corpus-only embedder build on the next process).

Import safety (the proposal's own mitigations, all pinned by test):
- import caps (200 rows);
- per-phrase length cap (120 chars, the learner's own bound);
- rows naming NON-EXISTENT tools import as no-ops with warnings,
  never exceptions (injection fuzz);
- the import report lists every tool the diff would boost;
- imports land as SUPERVISED PAIRS in the embedder seam (A2's
  ``labeled_pairs`` — never into the hand-seeded SYNONYMS, which stay
  a reviewed diff) and as review-bucket candidates for the learner's
  batch-review flow.

Embedder wiring (the one runtime consequence): PpmiEmbedder's shared
singleton (vectorize.embedder) reads the persisted pairs at its lazy
first build — an ABSENT import keeps the corpus-only build byte-for-
byte (the A2-measured default), which is why the fingerprint test in
test_svd_embedder pins the no-pairs build.

# EigenTrust (Kamvar, Schlosser & Garcia-Molina 2003, "The Eigentrust
# algorithm for reputation management in P2P networks", WWW) computes
# reputation as the fixed point of t = a*p + (1-a)*C^T t: direct evidence
# (the pretrust p) blended with what the graph propagates through
# normalized trust edges (C), iterated to convergence. This module has
# no peer-to-peer opinions — what it HAS locally is:
#   - direct evidence per signer: their diffs the user KEPT vs the diffs
#     the user ROLLED BACK (import/forget events above);
#   - edges worth propagating along: signers whose diffs boost the SAME
#     tools are correlated — a Jaccard overlap edge, so a rollback of one
#     diff also dents the signers whose diffs boost the same tools, and
#     a well-received diff lifts its correlated signers a little.
# The fixed point is computed by the same power iteration; the result is
# an ADVISORY score rendered next to the import report. It MUST NOT and
# DOES NOT auto-decide anything: every diff still lands as supervised
# pairs + review candidates, and the explicit review requirement is
# unchanged for every diff at every trust level (pinned by test).
