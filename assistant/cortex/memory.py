"""Episodic interaction memory — the cortex's recall layer.

Every routed request, clarification, and outcome is an EPISODE. Episodes
power three capabilities none of the one-shot layers have:

1. RECALL — "what did i change last week?", "what do i keep asking
   about?" — answered from real interaction history, ranked by an
   exponential forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus-style decay; recall weight
   ``w = 0.5 ** (age_days / halflife)``) so recent behavior dominates
   and old habits fade instead of poisoning the statistics forever.
2. ASSOCIATION — co-change counts: which settings get changed together.
   This is market-basket analysis (lift = P(a and b) / (P(a) P(b)))
   over the user's own applied episodes. It powers the proactive
   follow-up suggestion: after applying ``setBarScale``, the most-lifted
   co-occurring setting becomes a LEDGER PROPOSAL (never auto-applied),
   e.g. "you usually also tighten spacing when you shrink the bar —
   propose setSpacingScale 0.9?"
3. HABITS — surface frequency by hour-of-day and by day-of-week
   (plain histograms; ``notable`` deviations reuse the rhythm idea).

Persistence: the caller passes a plain dict (loaded/saved by the brain
state machinery — same atomic-write path as every other learned model);
this module does no file I/O itself. Bounded: ``MAX_EPISODES`` newest
episodes retained (recall beyond that horizon is honestly refused).
