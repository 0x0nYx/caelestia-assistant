"""cortex.plans — the session-scoped PENDING plan cache (phase 2.5).

The gap this closes: a follow-up request composed against the LAST
APPLIED state loses the PENDING plan. With what-if iteration ("make the
bar thinner", "and the dock smaller too", "actually spacing tighter as
well") the user amasses changes BEFORE committing; each turn must
compose against the ACCUMULATED pending ops, not just the live file.

This is the SHARED PRIMITIVE the what-if mode (settings/consequences.py
+ `settings --what-if`) consumes: one plan cache per session, carried in
the session dict (bridge round-trips it), read by the chat loop, the
what-if surface, and available to any future consumer — never
duplicated.

Composition semantics (mirroring the compound planner's own rules):
- ops compose by TOOL NAME, LATER WINS (the spoken order the compound
  layer already uses);
- the composed list re-VALIDATES through the standard planner before
  anything is proposed — the cache never bypasses validation;
- COMMIT happens only when an apply actually went through (the gate
  closes the loop); a refused apply leaves the ops pending for the next
  turn (that is the point);
- DISCARD is explicit ("never mind", "discard", "start over" in the
  chat loop) or implicit when a new topic produces a plan whose ops
  fully replace... never — replacement only happens per-tool via the
  later-wins rule, so nothing is silently dropped.

Serialization: a plain dict in the session payload
(``session["pending_plan"]``); bounded to the last MAX_PENDING ops.
Pure module: no I/O — the caller persists (the session dict already
round-trips through the bridge/chat state).
