"""devflow.risk — a commit-risk score: McCabe cyclomatic complexity x
recent churn, both from CALLER-PIPED TEXT (the diffstat.py input
contract: no subprocess, ever — the import policy forbids one and the
caller already has the data)::

    git log --numstat > /tmp/log.txt
    python3 -m assistant.devflow risk --source changed.py < /tmp/log.txt

The two factors:

- COMPLEXITY: cyclomatic complexity per function from the ``ast`` of
  the supplied Python source — 1 + decision points, counting each
  if/elif, loop, except handler, assert, ternary, comprehension clause
  and (on 3.10+) match case, and each additional and/or operand
  (McCabe 1976, "A Complexity Measure", IEEE TSE 4). The PEAK function
  complexity is the risk driver.
- CHURN: the ``git log --numstat`` text parsed into commits (newest
  first, the order git prints); per-file churn decays by commit
  recency with a fixed half-life (default 5 commits), so yesterday's
  hot file outweighs a touch from last month. The parse reuses
  ``diffstat.parse_numstat`` for the file rows — one numstat
  implementation, not two.

    risk = peak_cc * log2(1 + decayed_churn)

Deterministic, pure, dimensionless. The score is a REPORT for the
human's review, not a gate: nothing blocks, nothing executes. A
non-Python or unparsable source is an honest refusal of the complexity
half (churn is still reported) — never an invented number.
