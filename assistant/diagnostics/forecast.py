"""diagnostics.forecast — predictive hardware maintenance from the
telemetry time series (exponential-build-4 E).

The gap: telemetry.py reads a snapshot; the battery/thermal advisor
trends a rate. Neither answers "trending toward failure in ~N days".
This module fits a LOCAL LINEAR TREND through a scalar series (SMART
reallocated-sector counts, thermal readings) with a STEADY-STATE
KALMAN filter (Kalman 1960, "A New Approach to Linear Filtering and
Prediction Problems", ASME J. Basic Engineering 82D — the standard
[constant level, constant slope] local-linear model, equations exactly
the textbook's, fixed gain F from the steady-state solution rather
than a per-step update), and projects the filtered level+slope
forward to the series' own alarm threshold.

THE HONESTY THIS MODULE CARRIES (matching the battery/thermal
advisor's standard):

  * the interval around the projection is the IID-RESIDUAL interval:
    sigma of the one-step INNOVATIONS (filter residuals) times the
    horizon, student-t-free because no distribution is claimed — it
    is labeled an INDICATION, not a probability of failure;
  * a linear trend is a LOCAL model: the report says so, and a series
    with fewer than MIN_POINTS points is refused outright rather than
    fitted;
  * SMART reallocated-sector counts can jump overnight (a failing
    disk is nonlinear, sometimes abruptly) — the report carries that
    caveat verbatim rather than smoothing over it;
  * the projection never acts: it is a suggestion string for a human,
    read-only like every telemetry consumer.

Pure stdlib, no RNG, deterministic; state is plain dicts for the
caller's learned-state JSON path. Nothing here reads /proc or /sys —
the CALLER feeds series (telemetry.snapshot() is the live reader);
this keeps the module pure and the I/O enumerated.
