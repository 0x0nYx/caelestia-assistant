"""diagnostics.fusion — weighted-Bayes combination of the confidences the
troubleshooting engines already produce, into one ranked diagnosis.

Three engines answer a troubleshooting question independently and each
attaches its own calibrated confidence to its own candidates:

- the diagnostics rule engine (engine.py) — each rule carries its own
  confidence;
- retrieval (retrieval/search.py) — BM25 scores over the repo's corpus;
- scan (scan/scanner.py) — streaming signature statistics over a log
  stream.

This module is a READ-ONLY DOWNSTREAM CONSUMER: it calls the engines,
reads their outputs, and never modifies them. The combination is
weighted Bayes in log-odds space — each source's confidence is one
likelihood-ratio update from a common prior, scaled by that source's
weight (with all weights equal and independent sources this reduces to
exactly the naive-Bayes likelihood-ratio product brain/naive_bayes.py
applies; the weighted form is the standard linear opinion pool in
log-odds space, Genest & Zidek 1986, "Combining probability
distributions", StatSci 1(1)). No source vote is invented: a source
with no evidence for a hypothesis ABSTAINS (its term is skipped), never
a silent 0.5.

Score calibration, per source (all deterministic, all documented):
- diagnostics: a rule's qualitative tier ("deterministic"/"probable")
  is NOT a probability and is never invented into one — the evidence
  strength is the engine's own per-candidate match score, mapped
  through the same saturating transform as every other unbounded score
  (see below); candidates without a numeric score abstain;
- retrieval: BM25 is unbounded, so a fixed-scale saturating transform
  c = s / (s + K) maps it into (0, 1) — monotone in the native score,
  K a fixed documented constant (default 1.0), no fitting step;
- scan: the same transform over a pattern's hit DENSITY (hits per
  line): one signature hit is prior-neutral (0.5), more hits are
  stronger — the conservative reading of a stream statistic.

One transform class for all three sources' unbounded native scores:
c = s / (s + K), monotone, deterministic, never claims certainty.

Hypotheses are caller-keyed strings (a rule id, a doc id, or any label
the caller maps them to via ``hypothesis_map``). No fuzzy joining is
performed here — merging two engines' candidates into one hypothesis is
an explicit, auditable caller decision.

Out-of-range values are REJECTED, never clamped (the settings layer's
own convention): a confidence outside (0, 1), a negative weight, or a
weight for an unknown source raises ValueError.
