"""Reverse lookup: matched diagnostic rule -> settings tools (A4, Tier A).

The closed loop this module closes: Layer 1 (diagnostics) answers "what is
broken"; the settings layer (issue #120) answers "change this setting".
When a rule's ROOT CAUSE is addressable by a settings tool, the report can
now say so — "the settings tools addressing this root cause are X, Y" —
instead of leaving the user to guess the connection.

The join is EXACT and VOLUNTEERED-ONLY, by design:

- a rule's ``references`` entries of kind ``doc`` whose anchor names
  ``assistant/settings/tools.json`` carry tool names explicitly
  (e.g. CL-idle-throttle-001's anchor: "assistant/settings/tools.json —
  battery-saver and gaming presets (setBlurEnabled/setAnimationSpeed
  citations)");
- tool NAMES (``setFooBar``) and registry PATHS (``bar.scale``) matched
  word-exactly inside the rule's fix texts and notes.

It deliberately does NOT join on noun vocabulary or fuzzy similarity:
"Bar/taskbar thumbnails ... broken" (CL-kde-thumbs-001) mentions
"thumbnails", a noun of ``setLivePreviews`` — but that rule's root cause
is desktop-cache staleness, and suggesting "turn live previews off" would
be a wrong fix delivered confidently. A join that guesses is worse than
no join; only references the rule itself volunteered are trusted.

Every mention resolves through the settings layer's own citation
registry (``tool_by_name`` / ``tool_by_path`` over tools.json — the
generated, per-tool-citation-verified, drift-guarded artifact), so every
cross-reference that leaves this module is a real tools.json id by
construction. Mentions that do NOT resolve are reported separately
(``unresolved``) rather than silently dropped — a rule naming a
nonexistent tool is a content bug someone should see.

PURE module: reads nothing from disk (callers pass the rule dicts the
engine already loaded); deterministic; no I/O, no execution.
