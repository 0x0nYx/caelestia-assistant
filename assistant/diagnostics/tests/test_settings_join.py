"""A4 — the diagnostics -> settings reverse-lookup join.

Contract under test (settings_join.py):

- EXACT, VOLUNTEERED-ONLY join: a rule's settings tools are only those it
  references explicitly (a doc anchor naming assistant/settings/tools.json,
  or exact tool names / registry paths in fix/notes text). Noun-vocabulary
  similarity deliberately does NOT join — CL-kde-thumbs-001 mentions
  "thumbnails" (a setLivePreviews noun) but its root cause is desktop
  cache staleness; joining would suggest a wrong fix confidently.
- 100% RESOLUTION: every cross-reference the join emits resolves to a
  real tools.json id — enforced across EVERY rule in rules.d, not a sample.
- UNRESOLVED mentions are surfaced, not dropped: the current corpus has
  none (pinned), so a future rule naming a nonexistent tool fails loudly.
- The closed loop is visible in the report: a matched rule with tools
  renders the "Settings tools addressing this root cause" line.
