"""The metamorphic arena (Group A1): variants AUTO-GENERATED from
registry metadata, lexicon direction pairs and deterministic typo
operators — run against the router with metamorphic invariants.

A metamorphic relation is a property that must hold across a
transformation when there is no single "right answer" to assert:

- ``paraphrase``     wrapping the request in politeness/intent frames
                     ("could you ...", "... please") must not change the
                     top surface;
- ``synonym``        swapping ONE content word for a same-meaning word
                     drawn from the shipped lexicon's own equivalence
                     classes must not change the top surface;
- ``unit_change``    re-spelling a value's unit ("15 pixels" -> "15px",
                     "50 percent" -> "50%") must not change the top
                     surface;
- ``typo``           one bounded edit (swap/delete/double, distance 1)
                     inside the request's longest word must still reach
                     the accepted set among the top-3 (the typo corrector
                     recovers it; ranking may legitimately shuffle);
- ``polarity_flip``  replacing a direction word with its antonym
                     (thinner <-> thicker) must NOT change the routed
                     tool (the value side flips, the OBJECT does not) and
                     must flip the extracted direction cue sign.

Every variant is generated DETERMINISTICALLY from the committed
registry/lexicon (no RNG): same inputs, same variants, same verdicts.
Consistency rates are reported with the same seeded bootstrap intervals
as the other suites, and the ratchet floors live in the test
(``assistant/eval/tests/test_metamorphic.py``), not in prose.
