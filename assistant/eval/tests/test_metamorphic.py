"""Metamorphic ratchet (Group A1): floors pinned at the first measured
levels, deliberately slightly below them. A regression under the floor
fails the suite; improvements are expected to RAISE the floors in the
same commit that measures them — never silently.

The floors are on CONSISTENCY (the metamorphic invariant held), per
transform, over the auto-generated dev variants. The suite is derived
(no committed set file); the same deterministic generator runs here, so
a future registry re-pin re-measures automatically.
