"""caelestia assistant — single entry point routing to every module.

  caelestia-assist diagnose FILE | selfcheck        troubleshooting rules (Layer 1)
  caelestia-assist ask "text" [--generative]        rules, then retrieval, then optional LLM
  caelestia-assist search "query" [-k N]            offline retrieval over repo docs
  caelestia-assist scan FILE [--pattern P]          one-pass bounded-memory log scanning
  caelestia-assist issue draft|list-similar ...     issue-report drafting (never submits)
  caelestia-assist settings "request" [--apply]     natural-language shell.json editing
  caelestia-assist brain <command> ...              lean intelligence layer (proposals)
  caelestia-assist brief                            the daily brief (ledger+plans+forecast)
  caelestia-assist chat | route "text"              learned cortex routing (confirmation-gated)
  caelestia-assist cortex report|recall|...         learning/memory dashboard
  caelestia-assist inbox list|approve|reject        unified pending-decisions inbox (four sources)
  caelestia-assist why [<id>|--engine ...]          one explainer over every engine's own output
  caelestia-assist do "anything"                    genius: universal intelligence layer
  caelestia-assist genius <command> ...             direct domain access (math/stats/...)
  caelestia-assist agent "goal" [--simulate]        agentic orchestrator (consent-gated)
  caelestia-assist shellkb <verb> ...              shell employee: CLI grammar, explain, how-to
  caelestia-assist api < request.json               JSON bridge for the brain (QML/IPC)
  caelestia-assist eval [suite] [--json] [--sealed] the measurement arena (dev/sealed sets)

Verbless front door: a first token that matches no
verb above is no longer a hard error. A token within edit distance 2 of
exactly one verb gets a "did you mean" prompt (the settings layer's own
correction style — never a silent guess); anything else is treated as
free text and routed through the cortex pipeline one-shot, so

  caelestia-assist "make my bar thinner"

works end to end: an answer, a pending plan, or a simulated agent plan.

Every module keeps its own safety rules; this file only routes.
