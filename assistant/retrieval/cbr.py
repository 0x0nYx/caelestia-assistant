"""retrieval.cbr — the Case-Based Reasoning cycle over caller-supplied cases.

Aamodt & Plaza 1994, "Case-Based Reasoning: Foundational Issues,
Methodological Variations, and System Approaches", AI Communications
7(1), 39-59 — the RETRIEVE -> REUSE -> REVISE -> RETAIN cycle this
module formalizes, layered on the BM25 retrieval this package already
ships. What was adapted: the cycle is instantiated for THIS assistant's
honesty rules (caller-supplied data, ledger-gated retention, explicit
abstention) rather than copied as a generic framework.

A CASE is a plain dict:

    {"id": str, "problem": str, "resolution": str,
     "accepted": bool, "source": str}

- problem:    the user-visible description text (what was wrong);
- resolution: what fixed it;
- accepted:   the recorded outcome (did the resolution work);
- source:     where the case came from ("issue #6", "docs/…", …).

THE CASE BASE IS CALLER-SUPPLIED (a plain list) — the same
caller-supplied-data pattern as brain/workspace.py, stated plainly:
this checkout persists no case store of its own, so the caller owns
the list and persists it through the learned-state path it already
owns. This module writes NOTHING except the one ledger proposal that
retain() files through the Ledger it is handed.

The four steps:

- retrieve(case_base, query, k): BM25 over the cases' problem texts.
  NOT a reimplementation: an in-memory index dict in exactly the shape
  indexer.build_index() produces, handed to the SHIPPED Searcher
  (search.py — Okapi BM25 with indexer's K1/B constants and the same
  indexer.tokenize vocabulary). Duplicate case ids are rejected with
  ValueError, never silently absorbed.
- reuse(case, query, ...): the ADAPTATION-RULE TABLE below — explicit,
  cited, data-driven; every fired rule is reported with its id and its
  changes, nothing is adapted silently. A resolution naming a settings
  tool that is absent from the registry (with no substitution rule to
  repair it) ABSTAINS instead of transferring a fix that cannot run.
- revise(adapted, validate_fn): the CALLER's validator marks steps that
  fail, with the validator's own reason; this module never applies
  anything (the settings planner's validation is the real validator in
  production; tests inject a fake).
- retain(case_base, new_case, ledger): the retain step is ITSELF a
  ledger proposal (brain/ledger.py, kind="cbr_case") — never a silent
  append. The caller appends the case to its own list only after the
  ledger's approve/reject flow says so.

Deterministic and pure apart from the ledger call: no RNG, no
timestamps, no filesystem access. Two runs over the same inputs produce
identical bytes (pinned by test).
