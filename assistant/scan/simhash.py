"""scan.simhash — SimHash fingerprints for near-duplicate text detection.

A 64-bit fingerprint per text; two texts are NEAR DUPLICATES when their
fingerprints differ in at most ``threshold`` bit positions (Hamming
distance). This is the classical web-scale near-duplicate construction:
SimHash itself is Charikar's rounding technique ("Similarity Estimation
Techniques from Rounding Algorithms", STOC 2002), and its use for
near-duplicate detection at scale — 64-bit fingerprints, Hamming distance
<= 3 — is Manku, Jain & Das Sarma ("Detecting Near-Duplicates for Web
Crawling", WWW 2007).

WHY THIS MODULE (and not an existing one) — the non-duplication note:

- ``scan.bloom.BloomFilter`` answers EXACT-seen ("have I seen this exact
  line?"), with no notion of similarity; a repeated line with a new PID
  or timestamp is a new line to it.
- ``brain/minhash.py`` (MinHash + LSH banding) estimates Jaccard over
  shingle sets for the PERSONAL-NOTES module, storing a 64-permutation
  signature per document. Different layer, different data, heavier
  per-document state.
- SimHash here is the stream-side answer: ONE machine word per text —
  64x smaller than a MinHash signature — cheap enough to keep a
  fingerprint for every line of a bounded window, which is exactly what
  a bounded-memory log/clipboard scan needs. scan/ had no near-duplicate
  structure at all before this module.

Construction (deterministic, stdlib only): tokens are lowercase word
runs with their counts as weights (a text with fewer than two word
tokens falls back to character 3-grams, so short/garbled lines still
fingerprint stably); each token is hashed with blake2b (64-bit digest)
and its weight is added to / subtracted from per-bit accumulators; the
fingerprint bit is the sign of each accumulator. Order-independent in
the tokens (a set-similarity signal, like Jaccard over token multisets),
sensitive to token-mass shifts, and stable across rewording of
connective text.

HONEST OPERATING-POINT NOTE (measured, 2026-09-26): Hamming <= 3 is
Manku et al.'s operating point for LONG documents, where a one-word
edit barely moves the fingerprint. A log line has too little feature
mass for that: swapping "pid 1234, attempt 1" for "pid 9183, attempt 2"
measures ~15 bits apart on the raw text. The domain-correct fix is the
one journal dedup tools use — mask the volatile fields first:
``mask_digits=True`` replaces every digit run with ``#`` before
tokenizing, and those same two lines then fingerprint IDENTICALLY
(distance 0). ``NearDupTracker`` masks digits by default (its charter
is log/clipboard streams); ``simhash()`` defaults to the raw text and
takes the flag explicitly. Very short texts (< ~4 word tokens) carry
too little mass for ANY small threshold — mask or accept exact-match
semantics only.

Deferred with a measured reason: perceptual-hash-for-images. The cost
is NOT the blocker — measured on this machine (2026-09-26), a stdlib
pHash of a 1920x1080 PNG costs ~0.02 s (zlib IDAT decode ~0.01 s,
32x32 luminance sample ~0.000 s, naive 32x32 DCT ~0.013 s). The blocker
is format coverage: wallpapers in the wild are heavily JPEG, and the
stdlib-only import policy (ALLOWED_IMPORTS.txt) provides no JPEG
decoder, so a pHash here would silently cover only PNG — a partial
feature pretending to be a general one. If image near-dup matters
later, revisit with the coverage question answered first.
