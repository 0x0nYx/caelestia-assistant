"""Applier for the settings layer (DESIGN.md §5): plan -> written file.

This is the ONLY module in the whole assistant that writes anything, and it
writes ONLY when the caller passes ``write=True`` (the CLI's ``--apply``
gate — the equivalent of #120's confirmation step). Its write scope is
exactly four paths, all siblings of the explicit target file:

- the target file itself (via a transient ``.assistant-tmp`` + atomic
  ``os.replace``, i.e. POSIX rename(2));
- ``<file>.assistant-backup`` — the single-slot one-level undo (a
  zero-byte backup means "the target did not exist before the apply");
- ``<file>.assistant-tmp`` — removed after the rename; best-effort
  unlinked on any failure;
- ``<file>.assistant-history.json`` — the bounded undo history
  (history.py owns the schema; the applier appends after each successful
  write; oldest entries are evicted beyond history.MAX_ENTRIES).

NEVER: any other path, any parent-directory creation (a missing config
directory is an error, not a mkdir), any command execution (suggested
commands are inert ``SUGGESTED_NOT_EXECUTED:`` strings), any network, any
monitor-override file. Dry-run (the default) writes nothing at all.
