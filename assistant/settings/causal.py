"""assistant.settings.causal — causal attribution over the curated DAG
(exponential-build-5 F14).

Two questions, both answered ONLY from the shipped, citation-backed
consequences table plus the live state the caller supplies read-only:

  * ``why_chain(path, current)`` — BACKWARD: which armed interactions
    explain the current value of ``path``? Multi-hop (bounded, cycle-
    safe), every hop carrying the edge's citation, confidence and
    arming condition. A trigger value no curated edge explains
    terminates the chain as DIRECT ("set directly — see undo history"),
    never as a guess. An edge whose ``requires`` live value is missing
    is reported UNEVALUATED — the abstention the design demands.

  * ``counterfactual(tool, value, current)`` — FORWARD: "if I set X,
    what happens?" — the existing ``consequences.project`` projection
    (reuse, not re-implementation) EXTENDED with the honesty the what-if
    view never had: every curated edge that COULD have fired but could
    not be evaluated (its ``requires`` path missing from the live
    state) is listed as UNEVALUATED instead of silently staying quiet.

The honesty rules are the table's own: the causal universe is EXACTLY
the curated edges (bounded, growable by reviewed diffs); chains are
explanations OF CITED CODE, not causes in nature; and every unknown
needed value is an abstention, never a default.
