"""settings.consequences — what-if consequence-graph mode (phase 2.7).

Implements proposals/2026-09-26-c-whatif-consequences.md as specified:
a HAND-CURATED, citation-backed table of KNOWN cross-key interactions in
the shell's own code; a bounded, cycle-safe projection over a candidate
op list; the existing AC-3 conflict check extended to see induced
values; and a read-only what-if surface that renders consequences and
reversibility BEFORE the user consents.

The honesty rule (the proposal's own): a cited-edge list can be WRONG if
upstream changes — so every edge's cited file:line is re-verified
against the checkout by test (the registry's citation-guard pattern,
extended here). The consequence universe is EXACTLY this table:
bounded, auditable, growable by reviewed diffs — NOT a general model,
and NOT "fake open-endedness".

Purely read-only: this module reads op lists and the edge table; it
never writes, never applies, and nothing here is reachable from an NL
request that would apply — the parser/planner/applier spine is
untouched.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The interaction graph: every edge cites the shipped code that makes it
# true. Line numbers refer to the caelestia-kde checkout this registry is
# built from (verified by assistant/settings/tests/test_consequences.py —
# an edge whose cited line no longer matches its claimed content is a
# test failure, never a silent stale edge).
#
# Edge shape: {trigger_path, trigger_when, effect_path, effect, direction,
#              citation, confidence, note, effect_value}
#   trigger_when:  the value/condition of the trigger that arms the edge
#   effect:        what the trigger does to the effect path (human words)
#   effect_value:  the concrete value the edge induces on effect_path, when
#                  the edge sets one (machine-readable — feeds the AC-3
#                  induced-value check; edges that only annotate an INERT or
#                  CLAMP state carry no effect_value because they change no
#                  shell.json value)
