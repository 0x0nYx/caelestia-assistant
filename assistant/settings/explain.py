"""Explainability for the settings layer (issue #120), read-only.

Read-only: this module never writes anything. It answers "why does it look
like this" questions against the live config state (the target shell.json,
with registry defaults for unset keys — the same effective-value semantics
ConfigObject's fallback gives the QML side), in the exact style the issue
itself shows:

    "Blur is enabled because Glass Mode is currently active."
    "The launcher scale is currently set to 1.25x."

Grounding is the same registry + citations as every other tool: causal
answers come from registry.EXPLAIN_RULES (each rule carries its own
file:line citations); with no rule firing, the
answer is the live value readback with validation, default and the C++
declaration citation.

Honesty note (offline vs in-shell): the QML service evaluates the same
rules with LIVE session flags (GameMode.enabled, Colours.light). This CLI
only sees the file, so rules referencing _gamemode/_light do not fire
here — they fall through to the value readback instead of guessing.
