"""Config health linter for shell.json (issue #120 Phase 1.1).

A deterministic rule engine over the target config — the same discipline as
assistant/diagnostics/engine.py, but applied to the live shell.json instead
of pasted logs. Read-only: it never writes, it only reports findings.

Checks (each grounded in the frozen registry, never guessed):

1. unknown-key      — a leaf present in shell.json that is neither a registry
                      tool path nor a known not_exposed path. Likely stale,
                      renamed upstream, or hand-edited; the shell's ConfigObject
                      would silently ignore it.
2. out-of-range     — a leaf whose value is outside the shipped Nexus control
                      range transcribed in tools.json (the same range the
                      planner enforces on every apply; a hand edit is not
                      validated that way, so drift lands here).
3. type-mismatch    — a leaf whose JSON type differs from the registry kind
                      (bool/int/float/string/enum).
4. silent-noop      — a leaf that is currently having no effect because a
                      gate it depends on is off. Grounded in the registry's
                      own EXPLAIN_RULES: the blur regions gate on
                      transparency.enabled && blur together
                      (shell/modules/drawers/blur/BlurOffsets.qml:17), so
                      blur=true with transparency disabled is inert.
5. inert-customized — a strength/value leaf that differs from its default
                      while its master switch is off: the customization is
                      currently inert (reported as info, not an error).

Every finding carries: id, path, severity (error|warning|info), message,
cite (the registry fact that grounds it) and a fix hint. Exit semantics are
the CLI's decision; nothing here fails or writes.

lint_rules_ok() validates this module's own rule table (used by
`caelestia-assist selfcheck`, so a malformed lint rule fails the selfcheck
the same way a malformed rules.d file does).
