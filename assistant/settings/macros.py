"""Settings macros — capture an APPROVED proposal sequence as a named,
replayable template (exponential-build-3 C3).

Cypher (ed.) 1993, "Watch What I Do: Programming by Demonstration",
MIT Press — the programming-by-demonstration pattern: a demonstrated
action sequence (here: a settings change the user previewed, consented
to, and had applied) is recorded under a name and replayed on demand.
The capture/replay machinery itself is not novel and is not claimed to
be; what is engineered here is the CONSENT DISCIPLINE around it, which
is the whole point in a layer whose only writer is a gated applier.

THE CONSENT CONTRACT (read before trusting a replay):

- a macro is captured ONLY from an undo-history entry — i.e. from a
  proposal sequence that already passed the full preview -> consent ->
  apply gate once. There is deliberately no way to capture a macro
  from an unapplied plan: a template is a record of something the user
  actually approved, not something they merely asked about;
- REPLAY NEVER WRITES BY ITSELF. ``macro_ops`` returns plain planner
  ops (the same shape ``presets.preset_ops`` produces), so a replay
  rides the ordinary plan/render path: dry-run preview by default, and
  even with ``--apply`` the CLI demands the second consent
  (``--confirm`` or the interactive y/N) for EVERY macro — single-op
  macros included, deliberately stronger than the plain >1-change
  rule, because a replay's contents may no longer be in the user's
  head. The applied replay records its OWN history entry
  (label "macro: NAME"), so bounded undo works per replay;
- replay re-validates against the LIVE registry: ops carry tool names
  and the planner resolves them against the current tool table and the
  current file state. A macro recorded against an older registry (a
  renamed/removed tool) produces an honest error entry and a blocked
  apply, never a silent write; a macro whose values are already in
  place is an honest no-op ("no changes needed").

STORAGE (no new write surface): the macro store lives INSIDE the
existing undo-history file at ``<target>.assistant-history.json``,
under a bounded ``"macros"`` key — the same file, the same
``history._save`` atomic write path, the same sibling path as the A3
``undo_log`` precedent, so the applier's documented four-path write
scope (and test_safety.py's directory-snapshot assertion of it) is
unchanged. Capture and delete are explicit user commands (like undo
itself); the target file is never touched by this module — the
applier behind ``--apply``/``--confirm`` remains the only writer of
shell.json. The store is bounded (MAX_MACROS, FIFO: oldest capture
evicted first) so the config directory cannot grow without limit, the
same discipline the history ring applies.

Each stored macro is {"name", "label" (the captured request sentence),
"from_id" (the source history entry), "captured_at" (ISO-8601), "ops":
[{"tool", "path", "value"}]} — the APPLIED values only; the old values
stay in the history entry where they belong (a macro is not an undo
artifact).

Pure module apart from the documented history-file reads/writes: no
execution, no network, no RNG; same inputs -> same stored bytes
(the captured_at timestamp is the one field that differs per call, by
design and by precedent — history.record does the same).
