"""Pre-write sanity simulator for the settings applier (issue #120 Phase 1.2).

Deterministic, named-algorithm checks over the POST-apply state, run by
applier.apply() before anything touches the disk — including single-setting
applies, which are exactly the ones that skip the multi-change preview.

Checks:

1. Minimum tap-target size (WCAG 2.5.8 "Target Size (Minimum)", 24x24 px):
   the projected bar.dock.iconSize below 24 px is reported. The shipped
   control allows 16 px, so this is a WARNING with the citation, not a
   refusal — refusing would break presets the shipped controls themselves
   define (the registry's own `minimal` preset sets 20 px). The assistant
   flags the accessibility cost; the shipped range stays the authority.

2. Projected WCAG contrast (WCAG 2.x relative-luminance contrast ratio, via
   assistant/genius/creative.py::contrast_ratio — the same code the
   caelestia_genius_palette bridge tool uses): when the caller supplies a
   scheme (a {"role": "#hex"} mapping, e.g. exported from the shell's scheme
   system), every role pair is contrast-checked on the projected state and a
   ratio below 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3 AA, normal text) between a text role and a
   background role is a REFUSAL: the apply exits nonzero with nothing
   written. When no scheme is supplied the check is honestly skipped —
   shell.json itself carries no color leaves (colors live in the scheme
   system, outside this write path), and pretending otherwise would be a
   fabricated check.

Refusal semantics: applier.apply raises ApplierError("sanity ... nothing was
written") before the backup file is touched, so a refused apply leaves the
target, its backup, and the undo history byte-identical. Dry-runs (write=False)
never run the gate at all — the caller sees the same dry-run result as before.

The scheme parameter is optional in every signature; existing callers are
unaffected.
