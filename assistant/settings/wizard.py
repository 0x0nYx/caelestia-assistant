"""First-run setup wizard (issue #120 Phase 3 roadmap: "setup wizards").

A handful of pairwise tradeoff questions over FOUR criteria — visual
fidelity, battery, minimalism, performance — are turned into AHP weights
(genius/decision.py::ahp, Saaty's pairwise method with the consistency
ratio), and the five shipped presets are scored against those criteria
with TOPSIS (genius/decision.py::topsis) to recommend a starting preset.

Everything reuses code that already exists and is already tested:

- the criterion scores come from `optimize.score_plan(profile, ops)` —
  the same scored objective profiles the #120 phase-3 optimizer ships;
  the four wizard criteria map onto them directly:
      visual fidelity -> comfort, battery -> battery,
      minimalism -> minimal, performance -> gaming;
- the preset candidates are the registry's own five preset bundles
  (compact, minimal, gaming, battery-saver, macos-like) through
  presets.preset_ops — the same validated bundles the --preset flag
  applies;

and nothing here writes: the recommendation is returned (and rendered)
with its bundled ops for the caller to apply through the EXISTING
--preset/--apply/--confirm gates or the ledger. A recommendation the
user ignores costs nothing.

Note on question count: four criteria give C(4,2) = 6 pairwise questions.
decision.ahp validates full-matrix reciprocity, so a spanning subset of
questions would need invented cells; six is the honest minimum. The
answer scale is deliberately coarse (5 options per question) so the
wizard stays a few seconds long.
